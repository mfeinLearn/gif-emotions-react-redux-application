# Step for project week
1. [] establish models & relationships
2. [] build out our Rails API back end

4. [] wire-framing the front end  
  a) [] including at least an idea of the components we will be using.
  b) [] what our app will look like
  c) [] think about components
5. [] `create-react-app` - to scaffold our front end
6. [] add some seed data and double-check our models in a rails console
7. [] add Redux and establish our store
8. [] add a couple components
9. [] LET'S NOT GET ALL THE USER INFO! LIKE, NO
<!-- 10. [] WHERE WE ARE -- just updated gifs index controller action so that we can get the current user's trips on load..." -->
11. [] NEXT UP - add actions/reducers/state/props needed for this to happen
12. [] we can think about our initial layout
13. [] we can think about routes -- adding react router
14. [] we can think about bringing in a 3rd party css library
15. [] we can think about creating resources -> gifs, emotions, humor_types
16. [] We added functionality around crating gifs
17. [] don't send bad data to the back end
18. [] add css

Some stretch goals:

Adding more personalization to your gif selection
1. add favorite attribute for gif model
2. allow login/signup functionality - user account
3. associate the gif with the  "phrase"
4. filter through your search only based on your favorite shows/tv/comics
5. when you search a word and their is no response you can create your own gif
